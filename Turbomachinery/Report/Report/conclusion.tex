This experiment illustrates the general structure of a flow inside of a turbomachine. Furthermore it elaborates how to compute various angles, pressures and velocity components from a single five-hole measurement. The importance of the flows shape to improve the blades is obvious. Even though the flow is highly unsteady this measurement method provides expressive results without having as much data as in an unsteady technique.
